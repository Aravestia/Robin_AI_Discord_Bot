Birds are born with no shackles
Then what fetters my fate?
Blown away, the white petals
Leave me trapped in the cage
The endless isolation
Can't wear down my illusion
Someday, I’ll make a dream unchained
Let my heart bravely spread the wings
Soaring past the night
To trace the bright moonlight
Let the clouds heal me of the stings
Gently wipe the sorrow off my life
I dream
What is meant by "miraclе"
A word outside my days?
Once again, repеat warbles
But how could I escape?
No further hesitation
On those unanswered questions
So now, I'll make a dream unchained
Let my heart bravely spread the wings
Soaring past the night
To trace the bright moonlight
Let the clouds heal me of the stings
Gently wipe the sorrow off my life
I dream
We rise together as our destiny unfolds
We face the darkness and our trials are yet untold
Through the shadows of despair
Oh, in silence, hopes we share, woah-woah
To chase our dreams that we've declared
We glimpse, through our eyes
Yet fools, blind our sights
Can't make what they say
We'll find our way, we'll find our way
Heads up! The wheels are spinning
Across the plains, in valleys deep
To dawn, the wheels that sing
An unending dream!
Heads up! Thе tracks are running
Across the plains, wherе shadows hide
We run, we stride, woah-oh
In the face of fear and plight
And yet we hold our ground, woah
In life we stand and strive
Our victory is found
And the storms we've weathered through
And we hope in the light of truth, woah-oh
To break free from chains and come anew
Heads up! A steady rhythm
A destination that's ever near
It comes! Stride to our kingdom
And see the light of day
Heads up! The wheels are singing
The whispers and secrets they'd keep
To hope! We bound, woah-oh
Break free, we chased our dreams, beneath the starry night
In the face of god, we rose, as one
Mend your pace, sway to the beat
Hands up! Embrace who you wanna be
We're reaching heights unseen, oh-woah
Feel the fire deep within
You're the key to where my trust begins
Join my dream, it's just the right time, woah-oh
Leave it all behind
Get ready now
Rise up into my world
Renew your definition
World so high, let me show
And hear my declaration
No more ties
Off the ground and tap your feet
Look, stars are near when you feel the beat
We're bound for a greater height, oh-woah
Take a leap into the blaze
Don't lose yourself in mundanity
Join my dream, it is the right time, woah-oh
Get ready now!
Now hear my declaration
World so high, we'll show
And go beyond horizon
Side by side
In candlelight, as time unwinds
I find myself, lost in your eyes
In midnight tolls, as darkness folds
I see your tears, when we say goodbye
Watching stars, as we drift on by
A touch, a glance, fly away
Will our paths converge 'neath the sun?
A silent desire in melody sung
Beyond this stolen night
We share a cherished dream
Between souls whispered that it seems
Will shooting stars align 'neath the sun?
In whispered hopes where journey's begun
In dreams we waltz the sky
You watch me drift on by in your memory
A whispered song
A seed of hope where we belong
Wrapped in biting wind
Hearts will never bleed
Frozen and banished
Out of grief
In their restless dreams
They try so hard to breathe
Pulses flutter and sting
Within this bleakness
Ah-ah, ah-ah
The only warmth remains
In hands clasped so tight
The only fire exists in brave hearts
Seasons that refuse to change over the years
Will find their way back
Back on track
We've made a choice, go fight against your fate!
Pain will come with the blade
Pain will wake up the despondent crowd in this dormant world somehow
Unsheathe a sword not to kill
Unsheathe a sword to rend those clouds above the ground
Wake up, it's time to gather now
Forget about the rules written on weathered rock
There were chasers of light
Find the way or get lost
We have no way to know where they all headed for
See the light from afar, just blaze through the thorns
We know it's right over there
We have something to declare
Whatever is arriving, we'll be prepared
Wake up to hear the cheering sound
